/*
    Database configuration

    This is the example configuration file for the Rocket MV Basic for VS Code extension.
    The configuration file should be at .rmv/config/db.mvbasic.json.

    Configure the following items:
    - db:{}                 This object defines the connection details to the U2 server.

    - accounts: []          This array of objects defines paths on the local machine to other accounts.

    - catalog: {}           This object allows autocompletion for CALL statements and 
                            enables "Peek" and "Go to Definition" to access the source code.

    - includeMapping: []    This array allows autocompletion for INCLUDE files and 
                            enables "Peek" and "Go to Definition" to access the source code for an INCLUDEd item.
